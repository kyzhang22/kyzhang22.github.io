abstract: Combined therapeutic strategies have demonstrated their importance in addressing complex diseases, particularly among patient populations where monotherapy is less effective. Compared to single drug treatments, the use of drug combinations can reduce the occurrence of drug resistance and enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. Therefore, developing effective combination therapies through clinical trials holds significant importance for researchers and society as a whole. However, facing a vast library of compounds, conducting high-throughput drug combination screening is not only challenging but also costly. To overcome these difficulties, researchers have developed various computational methods that utilize biomedical data related to drugs to efficiently identify potential drug combinations. This study has developed a novel multi-channel representation learning framework based on knowledge graphs and Transformers models, aimed at predicting drug synergy. Unlike full-graph analysis, we employ a node-centric sampling strategy to extract subgraphs for learning node representations. Furthermore, we utilize a relation-based self-attention mechanism to handle complex relations between nodes. Through the multi-channel network, we input drug molecular structures, cell line information, and biomedical knowledge graphs into different channels, and fuse the feature representations of these channels to enhance the accuracy of drug synergy prediction. Our model benefits from both the structural features of drugs and rich biomedical background information. Extensive experiments on two representative databases have validated the effectiveness of our model.

summary: A multi-channel representation learning framework based on knowledge graphs and Transformers for drug synergy prediction.
